                    <p align="justify">Cornell University ChemE Car is a student-run project team of approximately fifty members. Since it started in 2004, the team has won first place in the AIChE Regional and National Conferences several times, with the team most recently obtaining their fourth national title (an all-time record) at the 2015 AIChE National Conference.</p>
                    <p align="justify">ChemE Car is one of several stellar opportunities Cornell students have to apply the theoretical principles they learn in class to real-life situations. All members work in smaller sub-teams to design and execute a specific aspect of the vehicle. Following months of design, construction, and calibration, all these parts are put together to make the final car. The goal of each car is to carry a certain load over a given distance. Because the constraints (distance to travel, load to carry) are declared during the competition, our cars are designed to be quite flexible.</p>

The power teams include Battery, Fuel Cell, Pressure, Biological Systems, and Thermo-Electric Generation; they are responsible for designing a new mechanism to power the car each year. To build the chassis, set up the electronics, and design a stopping mechanism, we have three support teams: Mechanical, Electronics, and Potions. Finally, to make sure everything between the teams and outside of the team runs smoothly, ChemE Car has Safety and Business teams in addition to a senior and junior standing captains, and a treasurer. Members are assigned to a specific sub-team during recruitment, but as our members know, there is no such thing as strictly being a sub-team member: due to the nature of our goal, each member will have to work with several sub-teams. Some of our members even belong to multiple sub-teams.</p>
