                    <h2>What is Cornell ChemE Car?</h2>
                    <p align="justify">ChemE Car is an annual competition sponsored by American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AlChE). The goal of the competition is to build a chemically-powered car (roughly the size of a shoebox) which can travel 50-100 ft while carrying a water payload of 0-500 mL. Each spring, AIChE holds nine regional conferences. The top three winners move on to compete in the national competition held in the Fall. Cornell competes in the Northeast region against MIT, RPI, Northeastern University, University of Maine etc.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>The Competition</h2>
                    <p align="justify">The competition is held on a course which can be anywhere from 50 to 100 feet in length. At the beginning of the competition, the judges announce the distance the car has to travel  and the water volume (0-500 mL) that the car must carry in a container while traveling the assigned distance. There are two rounds in the competition. The order of the first race is determined by teams' score during the poster session. The order of the second round is determined by performance during the first round. The higher your score in the first round (that is, the closer you are to the target line), the later in round two you will go. 
                    <br><br>
                    During the competition, an extremely important rule during the race is that when the announcer calls start, a car must start moving, traverse the distance, and come to a complete stop within two minutes. This rule has been the bane of many excellent cars, which are just unable to travel the distance or stop within this time.But the main reason for all car disqualifications at competitions are due to safety violation, as in recent years, due to some publicized accidents, AIChE has made safety the prime focus of the competition. Each team is required to submit a Job Safety Analysis (JSA) months ahead of the competition, detailing the safety aspects of the car. Take safety seriously.
                    <br>
                    <h2>Competition Rules</h2>
                    <p align="justify">For a comprehensive explanation of the competition rules, please refer you to AIChE's official competition rules. The main rules are highlighted below: <br>
                    When disassembled, the car must be able to fit into a 40 cm by 30 cm by 18 cm box. It must be capable of safely holding up to 500 mL of water. In addition, the car must be powered by chemical reactions only, and should cost no more than $2,000. Kits (i.e. a common fuel cell car) cannot be used without extensive modification and commercial batteries are not allowed. More importantly, the car cannot have any brakes or other mechanical/electronic stopping devices. There will be a poster session prior to each competition and a panel of judges will inspect the car. Safety is the primary concern of these inspections, but there will be opportunities to discuss novel design features of the car, environmental and safety features, etc. Teams must score at least 70 out of 100 in the poster session to be allowed to race.<br><br>A full list of rules can be found <a href="http://www.aiche.org/community/students/chem-e-car/chem-e-car-competitionr-rules">here</a>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Weekly Meetings</h2>
                    <p align="justify">During the 2015-16 academic year, the team meets on Wednesdays at 5:00 P.M. in Olin Hall, Room 165. Each sub-team will hold weekly meetings at different times throughout the week (contact the corresponding sub-team leaders for the time and location). Anyone is welcome to attend these meetings.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Advisors</h2>
                    <p align="justify">Our advisor is Prof. Roseanna Zia, the James C. and Rebecca Q. Morgan Sesquicentennial Faculty Fellow, who has been our advisor for the last 3 years.
                    <br>
                    We would also like to recognize some of the other contributors to the team:<p>
                    <li align="justify" style="font-size:16px">Professor Lynden Archer, the William C. Hooey Director of the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, for his enthusiasm and support by allowing us to use some of his lab space.</li>
                    <li align="justify" style="font-size:16px">Professor Paulette Clancy, the previous William C. Hooey Director of the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, for her continued support of the car team.</li>
                    <li align="justify" style="font-size:16px">Glenn Swan, for his continued help with fabrication and all things machine shop-related.</li>
